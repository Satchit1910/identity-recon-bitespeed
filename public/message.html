  <h1>Hello Bitespeed!</h1>
  <h3>I had a great time doing this assignment and it's a great change doing assignments like this 
    instead of applying with just your resume and waiting for a coding test link.</h3>
    <h3>I really like your idea of conversational commerce for shopify brands and would love to contribute and be a part of it.</h3>
    <h3>I absolutely loved the 3 points you wrote as the purpose of Bitespeed and I feel my thoughts do resonate with those purposes.</h3>
    <h3>What I have been wanting to do is to see my work being impactful and meaningful. So I feel working at startup like Bitespeed would be 
        right place to do this and grow as an engineer and as an individual.
    </h3>
    <h2>So yes, I would love to join this "career gym" that is Bitespeed!</h2>
